#+TITLE:  An Example of Demo-It
#+AUTHOR: Howard Abrams
#+DATE:   2014 Jul 29

This document is a simple presentation that can show off the
many...well, the few features of the =demo-it= project.

* Introduction

  Demo-It is a very simple project that allows you to execute
  pre-defined steps within Emacs.

  I use it along with org-tree-slide in order to begin with a
  nifty-swell presentation explaining the source code I've written.

#+begin_src sh
  source stuff.sh
  if [[ ]]

#+end_src

* Source Code Highlighting

  We can show source code using Emacs'
  built in capabilities, including connecting
  to a REPL.

  Of course, this depends on what source
  code and how well you have integrated
  that language with Emacs. ;-)

* Code Demonstration

  At this point, we can assume that we
  have some sort of script that would be
  great to actually run in a shell...
