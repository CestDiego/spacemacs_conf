;;; Commentary:

;; This is an interpreter/debugger for  Chris Pressey's wonderful
;; 2D Befunge programming language.
;; See http://www.catseye.mb.ca/esoteric/befunge/ for details
;; and Befunge sources.
;; Befunge just cries out to be run in an Emacs buffer; there are
;; faster ways of running it but this mode provides a nice
;; visual environment for debugging or development :-)
;;
;; This mode is for "Classic" Befunge-93 only (IMHO much the best
;; version, on account of its beautiful Scheme-like minimalism).
;;
;; In order for the examples sinus.bf and mandel.bf to work,
;; the stack has to be of >= 32 bit signed longs, as in the full Befunge
;; specification (as deduced from the behaviour of Chris Pressey's
;; C version). To get this to work I have used the bignum implementation
;; from the calc package, which must be installed. (Thanks
;; to Deepak Goel's tip on the EmacsWiki for this.) If for some
;; reason you don't have calc installed, you'll need to replace all
;; the math-* functions by ordinary equivalents, i.e -
;;
;;         (car (math-idivmod x y)) --> (/ x y)
;;         (math-add x y)           --> (+ x y)
;;         (math-sub x y)           --> (- x y)
;;         (math-mul x y)           --> (* x y)
;;         (math-imod x y)          --> (% x y)
;;         (math-lessp x y)         --> (< x y)
;;         (math-equal x y)         --> (= x y)
;;         (math-format-number x)   --> x
;;         (math-read-number x)     --> (string-to-number x)
;;
;; Installing calc is very simple with Emacs 20; get calc-2.02f.tar.gz
;; untar and follow the instructions. It's not so trivial with
;; Emacs 21 as you need to apply a patch to the calc sources first
;; (although in fact the parts of calc needed for Befunge do not
;; require this; but it seems possible that you might want to
;; use calc for some other purposes too).
;;
;; Incidentally, sinus.bf needs to be able to write and retrieve
;; a -1 as a character in FungeSpace, so signed characters must be
;; emulated; see the befunge-get function below.
;;
;; I actually wrote this interpreter partly for an iPAQ running
;; Rainer Keuchel's amazing Emacs 20 port (http://www.rainer-keuchel.de
;; for this and many other good things ported to wince). In the
;; function befunge-run-finished-p there are a couple of adaptations
;; to help with running the interpreter on a PocketPC.
;; It is mainly developed using Emacs 20.7 but runs under 21.2,
;; though with one or two problems to do with the way focus behaves.
;; It doesn't work with XEmacs.
;;
;; See also the docstring for befunge-mode below.
;;
;; I'd be most grateful for any improvements, extensions &c.
;; Any Emacs gurus reading this won't need to be told that I'm no elisp
;; expert; if anybody sees how to do part or all of it better, that
;; would be wonderful.

;;; Usage:

;; Put this file (preferably byte-compiled) in your Emacs load-path
;; and then add something like this to .emacs :
;;
;;  (autoload 'befunge "befunge-mode" "Befunge Interpreter/Debugger" t)
;;  (autoload 'befunge-mode "befunge-mode" "Befunge mode"   t)
;;  (setq auto-mode-alist
;;       (cons (cons "\\.be?f$" 'befunge-mode) auto-mode-alist))
;;
;; You must have calc installed for this file to work (see above).
;; I suggest you do (blink-cursor-mode 0) in Emacs 21.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl)
(require 'hscroll)
(require 'calc)

(defvar calc-command-flags)

;; there is a mode for Befunge source, interpreter-mode  for the interpreter
;; and interaction-mode for the output buffer. This is "Interactive" in that
;; keyboard input is echoed to befunge-output. Lastly there is a mode
;; of its own for the befunge-stack display buffer.

(defun befunge-mode ()
  "A mode for Befunge source files.

In befunge-mode, you get a menu option to start a Befunge
interpreter. This has two buffers: the interpreter itself,
befunge-buffer, and an output/interaction buffer,
befunge-output. Once in the interpreter you can load a different
Befunge source if you want. In the interaction buffer you have
menu options to stop or start Befunge or to switch to the
interpreter buffer. The interpreter buffer has many more
options; you can introduce a delay to slow down the visuals,
pop up windows displaying the Befunge stack or the end of the
interaction buffer, and debug by editing the FungeSpace, altering
the PC direction or position, and setting breakpoints.

The stack display window has its own menu, with the options just
 to quit or to edit the stack.

You can feed the contents of a buffer into Befunge as input
instead of typing in input interactively using the <Use File
for Input> option in the interpreter or in the befunge-mode menu;
thus you can easily run cat.bf or rev.bf on a file.

There's a bit of stuff for horizontal scrolling in the Interpreter
window, with a menu option to toggle  hscroll-mode; the right & left
keys move the _view_ right or left - opposite of the text movement!
when Befunge is running. This is included for the convenience
of Pocket PC users.

  "User interrupt handler.

This function finds out if befunge(-fast)-run has been stopped,
other than by coming to @. When Befunge is running, this function
is called at the top of the interpreter loop if input is pending,
and inside the input reading functions. If the user has requested
toggling of the interpreter and interaction buffers, this function
returns t, which leads to the interpreter stopping, but it backs
up the list of unread commands so that Befunge immediately restarts
in the new buffer, giving the illusion that the run has not been
interrupted.

This function does the actual callbacks when a menu selection is
made while Befunge is running; it also handles ^C+key options
and needs to check that they correspond to menu options that
are actually displayed, e.g. not C-c C-o when we're in the
interaction buffer.

FIXME:
Menu-bar events don't seem to be generated in Emacs 21 within
a running Befunge if the toolbar is disabled; if you get
rid of the toolbar by setting tool-bar-lines to nil, it prevents
you selecting a menu until Befunge is stopped.
The ^C options _do_ work. I've not been able to work this out."
