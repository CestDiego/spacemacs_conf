;;; Summary:
;;;
;;; Defines a minor mode `narrow-reindent-mode' that reindents the region
;;; narrowed to. The region is then indented again after widening the buffer.
;;;
;;; Code:

(defvar-local narrow-reindent--point-min 0)
(defvar-local narrow-reindent--point-max 0)
(defvar-local narrow-reindent--indent-amount 0)

(define-minor-mode narrow-reindent-mode
  "Toggle Narrow-Reindent mode.

When Narrow-Reindent mode is active, after narrowing the buffer
is re-indented. After widening, this narrowed region is
re-indented again. This mode uses the `indent-region' to perform
indentation."
